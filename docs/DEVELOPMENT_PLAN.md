# JB Asset Manager — Development Plan

This document defines the iterative development plan for JB Asset Manager. Issues are numbered sequentially and should be worked on in order. Each issue is self-contained with clear acceptance criteria.

> **Strategy**: Phase 1 delivers a minimal POC that can be demoed to users for feedback. Phases 2 and 3 add depth based on that feedback and may be re-prioritized after the POC demo.

> **Domain Rules**: All entity names follow `docs/agents/AGENTS_DOMAIN.md`. Never use the word "Property" as an entity name. Use `RealEstateAsset`, `RentalUnit`, `Building`, `Parcel`, etc.

## Current State

- ✅ Welcome screen (`GuestWelcome.js`)
- ✅ Add Real Estate Asset form (`AddRealEstateAssetScreen.js`)
- ✅ `RealEstateAsset` model with factory function
- ✅ Navigation (Stack Navigator: Welcome → AddRealEstateAsset)
- ✅ Jest test infrastructure (9 tests passing)
- ❌ No data persistence (save shows Alert only)
- ❌ No asset listing
- ❌ No asset detail view
- ❌ No edit or delete
- ❌ No maintenance tracking
- ❌ No financial features

---

## Phase 1 — POC (Issues 1–7)

**Goal**: A demoable app where users can create, view, edit, and delete real estate assets with basic maintenance requests. Data persists on-device.

---

### Issue 1: Add Data Persistence with AsyncStorage

**Priority**: P0 — Blocker for all other features

**Description**: Integrate `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` to persist `RealEstateAsset` records on-device. Create a storage service module that provides CRUD operations for assets.

**Files to create/modify**:
- Create `src/services/AssetStorageService.js`
- Modify `src/screens/AddRealEstateAssetScreen.js` (call save on submit)
- Modify `package.json` (add `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `AssetStorageService` exports: `saveAsset(asset)`, `getAllAssets()`, `getAssetById(assetId)`, `updateAsset(asset)`, `deleteAsset(assetId)`
- [ ] All functions use AsyncStorage with a `@jb_assets` storage key
- [ ] `AddRealEstateAssetScreen` calls `saveAsset()` on successful form submission
- [ ] Unit tests for `AssetStorageService` (mock AsyncStorage)
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

**Domain notes**: Storage keys use `assetId`, never `id` or `propertyId`.

---

### Issue 2: Asset List Screen

**Priority**: P0 — Core navigation flow

**Description**: Create a screen that displays all saved `RealEstateAsset` records in a scrollable list. Each list item shows the asset name, type icon, and city. The Welcome screen button changes from "Add Real Estate Asset" to "View My Assets" (or similar), and an "Add" button is available from the list screen.

**Files to create/modify**:
- Create `src/screens/AssetListScreen.js`
- Modify `App.js` (add route)
- Modify `src/components/GuestWelcome.js` (update navigation target)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `AssetListScreen` loads assets via `AssetStorageService.getAllAssets()` on mount
- [ ] Each list item displays: asset type icon, asset name, city
- [ ] Tapping a list item navigates to `AssetDetail` (placeholder for Issue 3)
- [ ] Floating or header "+" button navigates to `AddRealEstateAsset`
- [ ] Empty state shown when no assets exist ("No assets yet. Add your first one!")
- [ ] `GuestWelcome` navigates to `AssetList` instead of directly to add form
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh reloads the list
- [ ] Unit tests for component rendering (empty state and with items)
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

---

### Issue 3: Asset Detail Screen

**Priority**: P0 — Users need to view what they saved

**Description**: Create a read-only detail screen for a single `RealEstateAsset`. Displays all fields: name, type, full address, description, and notes. Includes navigation to Edit (Issue 4) and Delete (Issue 5).

**Files to create/modify**:
- Create `src/screens/AssetDetailScreen.js`
- Modify `App.js` (add route)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Receives `assetId` via route params
- [ ] Loads asset from `AssetStorageService.getAssetById(assetId)`
- [ ] Displays: name, asset type with icon and label, full address, description, notes, created date
- [ ] Header has back button, edit button (pencil icon), and delete button (trash icon)
- [ ] Edit button navigates to `EditRealEstateAsset` screen (Issue 4)
- [ ] Delete button shows confirmation dialog (Issue 5)
- [ ] Loading state while fetching
- [ ] Unit tests for component rendering
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

---

### Issue 4: Edit Asset Screen

**Priority**: P1 — Essential for POC completeness

**Description**: Create an edit screen that reuses the form layout from `AddRealEstateAssetScreen` but pre-populates fields with existing asset data and calls `updateAsset()` on save.

**Files to create/modify**:
- Create `src/screens/EditRealEstateAssetScreen.js` (or refactor `AddRealEstateAssetScreen` to support edit mode)
- Modify `App.js` (add route)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Receives `assetId` via route params
- [ ] Pre-fills all form fields with existing asset data
- [ ] Save calls `AssetStorageService.updateAsset(asset)` with updated `updatedAt` timestamp
- [ ] On success, navigates back to `AssetDetail` with refreshed data
- [ ] Validation rules match the add screen
- [ ] Header title reads "Edit Real Estate Asset"
- [ ] Unit tests for component rendering with pre-filled data
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

---

### Issue 5: Delete Asset Functionality

**Priority**: P1 — Essential CRUD operation

**Description**: Add delete capability to the `AssetDetailScreen`. Tapping the delete icon shows a confirmation alert. On confirm, the asset is deleted from storage and the user returns to the asset list.

**Files to modify**:
- Modify `src/screens/AssetDetailScreen.js` (add delete handler)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Delete button on `AssetDetailScreen` triggers a confirmation `Alert` ("Are you sure you want to delete this asset?")
- [ ] "Cancel" dismisses the alert with no action
- [ ] "Delete" calls `AssetStorageService.deleteAsset(assetId)` and navigates back to `AssetList`
- [ ] Asset list refreshes after deletion
- [ ] Unit test for delete confirmation flow
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

---

### Issue 6: MaintenanceRequest Model and Add Screen

**Priority**: P1 — Key differentiator for POC demo

**Description**: Create the `MaintenanceRequest` model and a screen to submit maintenance requests linked to a specific `RealEstateAsset`. This demonstrates the app's core value proposition: tracking maintenance.

- Create `src/models/MaintenanceRequest.js`
- Create `src/services/MaintenanceStorageService.js`
- Create `src/screens/AddMaintenanceRequestScreen.js`
- Modify `src/screens/AssetDetailScreen.js` (add "Add Maintenance Request" button)
- Modify `App.js` (add route)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `MaintenanceRequest` model includes: `requestId`, `assetId`, `title`, `description`, `priority` (low | medium | high | urgent), `status` (open | in_progress | completed | cancelled), `requestDate`, `completedDate`, `estimatedCost`, `actualCost`, `notes`
- [ ] `MaintenanceStorageService` provides: `saveRequest(request)`, `getRequestsByAssetId(assetId)`, `getAllRequests()`, `updateRequest(request)`, `deleteRequest(requestId)`
- [ ] `AddMaintenanceRequestScreen` includes form fields: title (required), description, priority selector, estimated cost
- [ ] Screen receives `assetId` via route params to link the request
- [ ] On save, persists via `MaintenanceStorageService` and navigates back
- [ ] Unit tests for model and storage service
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

**Domain notes**: Use `MaintenanceRequest` (not "Issue" or "Ticket"). Use `requestId`, never `id`.

---

### Issue 7: Maintenance Request List on Asset Detail

**Priority**: P1 — Completes the maintenance story for POC

**Description**: Show a list of maintenance requests on the `AssetDetailScreen`, giving users visibility into outstanding and completed work for each asset.

**Files to modify**:
- Modify `src/screens/AssetDetailScreen.js` (add maintenance list section)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `AssetDetailScreen` loads maintenance requests via `MaintenanceStorageService.getRequestsByAssetId(assetId)`
- [ ] Displays a "Maintenance Requests" section below asset details
- [ ] Each request shows: title, priority badge (color-coded), status badge, date
- [ ] Tapping a request could show details in an expandable view or alert (simple for POC)
- [ ] "Add Maintenance Request" button navigates to `AddMaintenanceRequestScreen`
- [ ] Empty state: "No maintenance requests yet"
- [ ] Count badge or summary (e.g., "3 open, 1 completed")
- [ ] Unit tests for rendering with and without requests
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

## Execution Notes for Agents

1. **Work issues in order** within each phase. Issues within a phase may have dependencies on earlier issues in the same phase.
2. **Follow domain naming** from `docs/agents/AGENTS_DOMAIN.md` — never use "Property" as an entity name.
3. **Follow coding standards** from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — functional components, StyleSheet, PascalCase files.
4. **Write tests** for every new model and storage service. Component tests should verify rendering.
5. **Do not break existing tests** — all 9+ existing tests must continue to pass after every issue.
6. **Use scoped identifiers** — `assetId`, `unitId`, `requestId`, `leaseId`, never `id`.
7. **Storage services** should follow the pattern established in Issue 1 (`AssetStorageService`).
8. **Phase 1 (Issues 1–7) is the POC.** Stop after Phase 1 for user feedback before starting Phase 2.
